As is fitting for you Buddhist disciples, you have held the mirror of this explanation in your right and left hands, approached the faces of the seven consciousnesses and distractions, seen the stain of the six dusty realms, and washed away the blame of attaching to the Dharma and the human and self. If you Buddhist disciples thus do, the three bodies of Dharma body, the three bodies of transformation, and the four virtues of eternal bliss, self, and purity are fully manifested as they enter the Lake of Attainment. I've descended from the four kings' sovereign positions into the great ocean, the palace of the dragon palace, and have peered into the sea.",
