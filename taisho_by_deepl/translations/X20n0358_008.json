A: If we talk about concentration in the Dharma nature, isn't there a difference between going in and out, explaining it in silence, and showing that its concentration is in accord with the capacity of things and the abilities of things, and that it's appropriate, enjoyable, and different. The sutras show that in the past, all buddhas first entered concentration and experienced the Dharma conditions to counteract the delusion of the scattered mind.",
