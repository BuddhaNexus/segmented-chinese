Those who want to avoid climbing the mountain of swords couldn't do more than fill a temple home with good earth, put fruit and wood in the kalaviṅka, and give seeds to double the number of permanent residents. Anīya's sinners are indescribable, having suffered sins for eons and sands, and have yet to escape from Buddha's nirvāṇa. From this hell, which stretches hundreds of miles to the east and west, sinners walk wildly, shoulder to shoulder, and the wind of karma blows fire forward, burning the jailer's branch from behind. Their hands should be like broken tiles, and their hands and feet should be like powder. Boiling iron rises up, sending a light into the mouth, piercing the left side of the body like a hole in the right side, and a bronze arrow flies near and shoots an eye, cutting the sword wheel straight down into the air.",
