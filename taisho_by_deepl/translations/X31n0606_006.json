This marvelous mind faculty knows the higher, middle, and lower dharmas ... and even hears a single verse and comprehends measureless meanings in sequence as they are explained in the teaching from the fourth month to the year. All sentient beings inside and outside the world, whether gods, dragons, humans, nightcrawlers, ghosts, or other spirits who are mindful of certain kinds of rewards of upholding the Lotus in the six destinies are all fully known at one time.",
