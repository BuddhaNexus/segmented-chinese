After eating, only sinews and bones remain, and when a cold wind blows, their skin and flesh return. They jump and dance in fear, make themselves comfortable in their place of suffering, and are maimed on the road. They enter the forest of the fearful sword. Their body then breaks apart, and their blood flows in torrents of pain. After emerging from this forest, they then enter the river of ashes like boiling beans that well up and boil, sometimes sinking or floating, and boiling hot ashes with juice. So it is with the jailers on both sides of the river who pierce their bodies with their forks, force them to swallow iron balls, or melt iron juice, seek to drink it, pour it into their mouths, scorch all over their bodies, and then emerge from below.
