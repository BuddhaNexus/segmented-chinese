A: That's mindfulness of the Buddha, then how is mindfulness of the Buddha not a teaching that analyzes emptiness and mindfulness of the store, the essence of emptiness and mindfulness of penetration, the sequence and mindfulness of distinction, unity of mind and mindfulness of completion, then how is mindfulness of the Buddha not a teaching that achieves both in one go? Whoever says there is no accomplishment of the former penetration and the latter integration is not called a taking, then there is no doubt that he will be reborn, but I'm afraid that he will produce a separate mind that is hung up on two paths, and the fault will be produced by himself, not the Buddha's teaching.",
