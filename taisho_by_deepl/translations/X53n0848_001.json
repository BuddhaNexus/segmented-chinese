        "translation": "The explanation is that there are three ways in which this fourth basis is not formed. First, the first sentence refers to the thesis, then the next two sentences identify the essence, and the last sentence concludes that there are three ways in which the first two kinds of basis are not formed, and the second two kinds of basis are not formed because the second one is not formed by the third constituent, and the third kind of basis is not formed by the same metaphor, such as when the lesser vehicle posits a thesis to the sound theory and so forth that the sound of the buddhas in other places is definitely impermanent, the cause for the establishment of the buddha's sound in other places is not permitted by the opponent, and the cause for the establishment of the buddha's sound in other places is generally without a basis.",
