        "translation": "One land is divided into four lands, each land has three bodies, and there's no end to the body and lands. The sentiment is precisely like a star. The Tathāgata's unhindered power resembles the moon in the heavenly circle, and the moon is seen in every state. Everywhere there's light, and the back song is a road that leads down to the heavens, and there are hundreds of states, each state has its own road, and the road combines spring and autumn. There's no mutuality in this way. Don't make a grudge. Nianfo's outline of mindfulness of the buddha is originally without trace or track. Conveniently, I'll show you. Some people have asked me what's the purpose. Namo Amitâbha Buddha's mind opens up in mindfulness of the buddha because he cultivates samādhi. I suddenly see the passing of the Maitreya Buddha on my mind, and I realize that my practices are all places of treasure.",
