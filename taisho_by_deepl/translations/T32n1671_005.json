        "translation": "\"Because of my deep misdeeds of defiled desire, I fell into the unremitting hell. By the Buddha's grace, I was born in heaven and made to realize the path to nirvāṇa. Because I relied on the pure eye of the Dharma, I was forever freed from the bad destinies of transmigration and the streams of future birth-and-death and was able to reach the shore of tranquil enlightenment. Now, I've come to see Lord Muni, a rare encounter in a hundred thousand lifetimes who well transcends the causes of birth, old age, illness, and suffering and should receive the world's extensive offerings, carry a jeweled necklace to present to him, fold my palms, circumambulate him to the right, and rejoice with my heart. Therefore, I salute the two-legged honored one who causes humans to be born with innate awakening and fortune, and who correctly practices what's gathered in Sutra Scroll 5.",
