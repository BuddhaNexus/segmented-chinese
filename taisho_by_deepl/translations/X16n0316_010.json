I was saddened by the legacy of the teachings, by the absence of a good understanding, and by the midnight examination of my own mind. In the morning, I discussed the topic with the white clouds, and in the evening, I left the bright moon to accompany me. Although I may have been manipulating the calabash to peer into the heavens and the Han, I really felt ashamed of the mouse drinking from the river.
