Those who understand this are called the great way. Praise the golden and purple purple Guanglu Dafu, Shouzhongshou Siren, Minister of the Household Department, and the Minister of the Under-Secretariat, Pinzhongzhong, Minister of the Great University of the Hall of Collective Virtue, written by Pei Xiu. All beings and buddha's dust and virtue are equally pervasive in the great store of Śubha's light. The awakening body now clearly shows that the lack of awareness ceases, the illusory mind is removed, the illusory mind is full of awarenesses, and awarenesses are not empty.",
