        "translation": "(Prof. 2:33) This is to explain the essence of contemplating objects and to show the subtle from the mind, which is to reveal the beginning of the totality of things. Having revealed the beginning, this question had to be posed as a lot of things, but it wasn't precisely to show the contemplation of objects that didn't allow time for detailed explanation, so I just pointed to three parables and examples to see them.",
