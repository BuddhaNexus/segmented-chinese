        "translation": "Having thus well established the principle of purity, and having seen the Dharma of all Buddhas, blinded by the various mistaken practices, may they abandon external attachments and attain the practice of insight. This land of nirvāṇa is the single, vast path illuminated by the light of the buddhas' daily sayings, where the practices of the noble ones are ripened in the principle of selflessness, even though the blind eye is opened, and no one sees it. The Bhagavān addressed Pūrṇa, \"You must diligently maintain this teaching. If people follow this cultivation and contemplation, they will surely attain the five and fifth virtues. This has revealed the correct direction of meaning, opened the gate of the poison of wisdom for the wise, and may they abandon external mistaken attachments in order to attain the true meaning for themselves and others.",
