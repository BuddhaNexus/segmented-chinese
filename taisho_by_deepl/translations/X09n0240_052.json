        "translation": "\"Suppose the true nature doesn't arise and cease, has no place, and has no visible object. Thus does the great benefactor conduct himself, transcending the three worlds immeasurably. The Dharma realm is neither a realm nor a non-realm, neither is it measured nor immeasurable, and so does the conduct of the great virtuous one. Like a bird flying a hundred million thousand years, there's no distinction between what's before and after in the vast sky and the many eons of explanation of the Tathāgata's conduct that's been explained and yet to be explained is immeasurable. Gold wings contemplate the vast ocean in space, cutting through water, wrestling dragons and men, and ten powers can pull out people of good roots, causing them to emerge from the ocean of existence and remove mental disturbances. Like the sun and moon swimming in the vast sky, the Bhagavān travels around the Dharma realm, teaching sentient beings without discriminating between the two.",
