There are six differences between the following theories: one, the former has craving and dislike; two, dull faculties and no wisdom; three, if there's little learning and seeing; four, if it's for the sake of nurturing fame and learning; five, for the sake of present happiness but wanting to gather oneself; six, if it's for a new renunciant who loves his wife (the latter two are missing from the commentary, so it's called the same thing.) The above six are appropriate to use the abbreviated teaching.",
