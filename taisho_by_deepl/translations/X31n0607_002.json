The frontier is the country, the farthest away, the government is the town, the neighborhood is the village, and the closest is the long man's practice of the name. These three places are not seen as subtle and ugly, but the far away is known as high and breezy, and the words are uncritical, the body is uncritical, the mind is uncritical, and the words and deeds are praised as true lords. Now, the analogy is that the land of true reward is the country, the land of skillful means is the town, the land of cohabitation is the village, and within these three lands, the three activities of the Tathāgata are praised, the abilities of those who teach are called universally heard, and the virtues of those who circumambulate the Dharma realm.",
