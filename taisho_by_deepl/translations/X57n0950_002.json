The Sutra says that if you want to give food to Brahmans and sages, the translation of the Dhāraṇī says that if you want to give food to Brahmans and sages (Brahmans and sages must be divided into two categories, which seems wrong), and the translation of the Dhāraṇī by Bukong says that you should give food to Brahmans and sages (not Brahmans and sages, which seems correct.) If you make two kinds of Brahmans, you should give food to ghosts that are not contracted by humans.",
