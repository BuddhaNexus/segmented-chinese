        "translation": "If you understand the source of birth and death, you must first have the eye to discriminate qualities, penetrate both practice and principle, and not become involved in doubt. With this pure white mind, you'll first pursue the unsurpassed path. It's like erecting a tower. First, you must build its foundation. It's also like a beryl vase that can contain the lion's milk. Teaching and principle are shared without obstruction, and it serves as an aid to the doctrine. To want to investigate the higher matters, simply mention one phrase and don't give rise to discriminating thoughts. This is called true stilling and insight. The gate of the five hundredfold peace of mind is suddenly transcended without thought. It doesn't involve the three vehicles, so why is it related to the five teachings? If it's cut off and revived later, you must be free of mindfulness in essence and mindfulness in distant isolation.",

        "translation": "\"The nature is inherently pure, not Buddha, not arisen, and all the tathāgatas in the ten directions are suddenly transcended by one gate, which refers to the mind in the causal stage, fulfills the practices in the fruition, knows the fulfillment, and attains perfect rectification. To not give rise to the notion of rectification is called true liberation. Like the illusory absorption, snapping the fingers, transcending the post-learner, and the pavilion master's lack of coming and going, the traveler's meaning is accomplished. To conceptualize the result and seek enlightenment is called a mistaken view. Seeing the nature as originally pervasive, things as originally empty, and the conditions for seeing it are all marvelously pure and clear.",
