I now call this an elder who must first leave home when he's young, cultivates his good roots, and discerns right practices. If there's a young person and a young man whose faculties aren't deficient, this is called an elder who discerns the right practices. The great treatise says that the characteristic of an elder needn't be old, but his body is thin, his hair is white, and he's an empty old man with no internal virtue who abandons the results of sins and merits, engages in the religious practice, and parts with all dharmas. This is called an elder who observes the precepts and speaks the Sanskrit term.",
