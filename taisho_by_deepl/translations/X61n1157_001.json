        "translation": "In the West, compassionate fathers are moved to lure the misguided streams back to the land of paradise. Early on, they go to the lotus dais and personally entrust their hostages. Don't cast off the worldly world and enter the twins. In the Pure Land of the West, there's the lotus womb, and sentient beings are universally encouraged to return. One thought opens the brush and personally sees the Buddha. There are never eight difficulties or three calamities. In the West, there's no discrimination between the rich and poor, no selection of the noble and the foolish, the noble and the base, no questioning of women and men, the elderly and the young, no distinction between monks and the common people, and the most dear to our families in the West. All of us who want to return to the land of paradise are now cultivating the cause of rebirth in the West. The paramount bliss of the West is honored by many, and people are universally encouraged to enter this gate.",
