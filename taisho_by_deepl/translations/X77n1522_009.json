        "translation": "'Desire is the cause, and greed for life is the effect.' 'That's a wonderful maxim, 'It's a burden to bear, a body subject to birth and death, a prisoner in the three realms, and a consciousness that recognizes self as an attachment to self, desires as a defilement, passions as a condition, life as an illusion, and shortcomings as a result of gods. These two kinds of greed are all bodily results. Therefore, they can abandon themselves and save the Dharma altar.' Tathāgatas, protects, and entrusts Sattva, the king of medicines, and is truly worthy of admiration.",
