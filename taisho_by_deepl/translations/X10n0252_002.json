According to Guifeng's commentary, the translator's error should be that it's the realization that all sentient beings have perfect enlightenment, meaning that our Buddha, the great sage, is the one who universally preserves and works for all sentient beings to realize that everyone possesses this vast nature of spiritual insight and perfect enlightenment, and that this nature has no bodhi to seek in the past, no sentient beings to save in the lower part, and no myriad practices to cultivate in the middle part. Therefore, everyone on the path has a wall that stands at a thousand feet, and one constant light appears in front of them.",
