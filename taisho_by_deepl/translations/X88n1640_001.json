        "translation": "\"Greetings to the three-bodied Buddha, who reveals the half-complete teaching, the three vehicles, noble monks, and those who protect the right teaching. Now, I'll briefly record that the mind's nature is contingent on sins and merits, and it doesn't contain the words of Chrysostom. It's because the sūtras are clear and the words of the noble ones are not clearly explained in the treatises. After the right teaching has ended, the five gods and the remote lands have recently been divided into four groups of people who believe and disbelieve what's wrong and right, and the wise should all examine it. Therefore, even if they see it for themselves or hear it from Luo, they should admonish those who come after them but only note a small part of it.",
