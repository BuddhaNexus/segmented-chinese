        "translation": "\"At the first watch of the night, he sits cross-legged, his mind is still and clear, and he's at peace with the transience. Throughout the ages, nothing arises or ceases, why should anything arise or cease without remainder? All things are illusory, inherently empty of that use, and if he realizes that his mind's nature is not an image, he's perfectly motionless and truly true. At the second watch of the night, he concentrates his mind and turns to clarity and purity, arouses no recollection, and shares his true nature.",
