        "translation": "There are three kinds of nirvāṇa, which are deludedly conceived by non-Buddhists and realized by the adherents of the two vehicles, and the Tathāgata's ultimate abiding in nirvāṇa. Although their names are the same, they are really quite different. If we don't correct their names with the Dharma, then the Tathāgata's secret store will be confused with ordinary lesser emptiness and delusion, which can't be discerned. Therefore, the reason for Dahui's question is to examine this fact. In his answer, Dahui first shows the ultimate nirvāṇa self-nature, which is the transformation of all self-nature accumulating karmic impressions, namely, the nine realms of form, the hidden mind, the consciousness, the transformation of views, namely, the eight consciousnesses, and other mental factors.",
