The question is how can it be said that the effects of the conditioned mental factors reach cessation only when they are produced by four conditions? The Vibhāṣā council says that this is called birth because the arising of a condition that has not yet ceased is generally called birth. The correct principle says that although the effects of the cessation of a condition are only formed when the conditioned mental factors are produced, the conditioned mental factors must rely on the two causes of conditioning and surprise in order to be produced (according to the correct principle, even though the conditioned mental factors reach the present condition, the conditioned mental factors are called effects that have the power to induce birth when they are being produced.) The Vibhā council also asks how the mental factors that arise from the two concentrations and look into the concentrated mind are separated from each other by a distance.",
