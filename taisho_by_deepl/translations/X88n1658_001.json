One bowl was then transformed into four, each of which would serve the Śākyamuni teacher. The Buddha pressed his hand and returned it to one, so that there would be no disagreement with his wishes. These gods live halfway up Sumeru, and the fourth story is surrounded by four rings. Their bodies are half a mile long and have transformed forms that come from their laps, and their bodies are half a mile long, with fragrant trees and spring-fed pools. 500 years of human life are rare, and the sun, moon, stars, and other directions are all ruled by the sun, moon, and stars, and the spiritual authority of the twenty-eight divisions of the world's protectors.
