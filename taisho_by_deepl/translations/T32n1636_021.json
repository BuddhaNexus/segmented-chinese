From this heaven he goes down, is born into a noble family, and during 100,000,000,000,000 eons receives excellent fortune, and always makes offerings everywhere to the wheel-turning sage king, the lord of Indra, the great Brahma king, the lord of the world. As a result of this gift, he obtains such excellent merit. Further, he gives the Buddha's great guide a garment and garland, and presents it to the Buddha's stūpa, far removed from the lower races, never to be born there, always surrounded by his retinue, free from suffering, with no distinctions, and always receiving the support and praise of great kings, or born among the gods and dragons, or worldly wise men, with courage and authority, whose rewards are unequalled.",
