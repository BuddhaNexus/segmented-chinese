        "translation": "\"When sentient beings see the Buddha, it's only with one mind that the Buddha liberates sentient beings, not apart from the great vow. The mind is like a mirror, the light that intersects and enters, the vow is like the ground, and seeds are born. Look at this: 'Great illusionists, suns gathered by suns, moons bearing by directions, originally have no past and future, and conditions exist for each other.' You should know that the Pure Land is likewise. It's also like two people who leave the gate and go back together, one adapts to swallows, one adapts to transgressions, and each goes to the end of their lives without being worthy of each other.",
