Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra answered the difficulty by saying that the nature of the tathāgatagarbha shouldn't suddenly give rise to artificial forms, so the Buddha must answer it with the principle that delusion really does become delusion and delusion originally doesn't arise. The present text is a statement that leads to two kinds of reliance on the principle and again identifies the Dharma aspect of the full nature.",
