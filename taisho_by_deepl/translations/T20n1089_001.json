        "translation": "If he wants to achieve the repose of disasters, he must first arouse the mind of patience and compassion, seek the stage of unsurpassed marvelous awakening, and not enjoy the minds of the two vehicles of śrāvakas. Furthermore, if he wants to achieve a great cause, he must first perform the method of converting hindrances. Taking 16 fingers of white sandalwood, he must hold it in his hand and burn it, calling it by its own name, and it's 108 or 108 times as many as he wishes. When he removes illness in others, when he ends great disasters in countries, or when he ends disasters in others and animals, he can wholeheartedly invoke a great sage to come to the gate of one of his great cities.",
