        "translation": "'All things arise from the mind, and all things cease from the mind. Our Buddha, the great ascetic, always says this. Observing precepts without faith and vowing to attain the Pure Land, one attains only the fortune of humans and gods, is subject to transmigration, and struggles to escape. Looking at the sūtras without the eye of wisdom, one doesn't recognize the Buddha's profound meaning. In a later life, one attains intelligence, and is unable to escape. Not as good as mindfulness of the Buddha, one's mind is disturbed, and it's better than mindfulness of the Buddha.",
