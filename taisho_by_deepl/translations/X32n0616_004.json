The womb sūtra says that Māra, Brahmā, and Śākyamuni all don't abandon their bodies, don't accept their bodies, and all become buddhas in the present body; what is the expedient and real answer? A. The womb sūtra says that becoming a buddha in the present body is about self-reliance, which destroys the delusion of ignorance; the real thing is that this sūtra says that becoming a man is about transforming others into the eight phases of the path; the expedient thing is that you should know that those who cultivate marvelous practices based on the perfect and sudden teaching can immediately become buddhas based on them.",
