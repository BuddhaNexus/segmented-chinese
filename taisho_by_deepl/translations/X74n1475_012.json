        "translation": "\"Don't keep each other company year after year. After the scattering of all the disciples in this assembly, how do you know who died and who was born? Once you enter the jade heap, your home is silent and you don't hear a sound. Even if your spirit's bed were a place to weep, how could you see your true form? Ordinary foolish people don't realize this. They are always addicted to the five desires and pleasures. In the Sutra of Mindfulness of the True Dharma (Ex. 37), a verse is spoken to rebuke those who don't contemplate their minds and are always subject to the pleasures of their activities. Long nights and long hours of sleep are spent in suffering and affliction that have never ceased. Because of their delusion, they enjoy pleasures and don't perceive suffering and affliction.",
