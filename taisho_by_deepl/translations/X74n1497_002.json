Finally, he proclaimed the wonderful Dharma on Vulture Peak, pointing out the expedient and the real, not others, sang out nirvāṇa and ceased, sorted out the remaining capacity, explained the true and ordinary people's buddha-nature, passed through five periods, all in order, and laid out the eight teachings as appropriate, knowing that they had never been more than 3,000, so now I diligently make offerings to guide them on the path to enlightenment.",
