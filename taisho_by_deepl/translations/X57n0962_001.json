This is the natural essence, the name above, and the refutation, the establishment, and the reality realm. This is the natural name below the essence.

The emptiness reveals the omnipresent virtue, the three refutations, the three thousand truths are each as they are, the hypothesis reveals the three establishments, the three thousand truths are each as they are, the middle reveals the marvelous virtue, and the reality realm, the three circumference, and the reality realm are each as they are. The three circumference, the causality, the reliance, and the correctness of the three realms are not outside of this, but are only in the ordinary single thought, the ultimate exhaustion, the ultimate talk of light, the profound realm, and no deliberation.",
