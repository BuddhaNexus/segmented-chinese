        "translation": "\"After wisdom removes the waves of consciousness, it's good to observe the three characteristics and well diligently practice them. First, he parts with the view that nihilism is not existent, and then he realizes that the Tathāgata is voluntarily arisen, that his nature and characteristics are suddenly forgotten, that he's attached to nothing, and that the world is illusory and unattached. From here, he's arrived at the hall of the king of emptiness, where noble wisdom is now firmly established, and the portion that rejects both existence and nonexistence is the fifth. At that point, the bodhisattva of great wisdom knows the thoughts of the minds of the great bodhisattvas (and) the one hundred and eight sentences that discern the basis.",
