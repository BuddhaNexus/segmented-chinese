All the three worlds are thus. Dreams have no arising or ceasing substance, nor do they have a place in the three realms, and they are all thus. Seeing them, the mind is liberated. Dreams are not of the world, nor are they not of the world. These two are not discriminated, and one enters the stage of forbearance. Like what's seen in a dream, the various forms are thus, and the world is thus. There's no difference between them and dreams. Those who abide in dream concentration understand the world all as dreams, not alike or different, not one or the same, and not various. All the bharma activities of sentient beings, free from defilement and pure, are thus fully understood and equal to dreams.",
