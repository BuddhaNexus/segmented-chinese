If a person with dull faculties doesn't know dhyāna and doesn't understand the teaching, yet his mind still enjoys straightforward cultivation and hears the great concentration, why would you be afraid of falling into mistaken views? Why would you protect them by causing them to concentrate their minds and single-mindedly maintain this dhāraṇī, then all Māra cannot disturb them because they see that both the manifest and the hidden are the unfathomable realm of the supreme and most excellent first dharma-gate of the great Buddha-top.",
