        "translation": "In clarifying the truth of the path, there are three initial questions, followed by answers and then explanations of the four practices. In the answers, there are two initial abbreviated forms of practice that show the function of the path, and then depending on the stage, they show the essence of knowing suffering, ending set, realizing cessation, and cultivating the path. The fifty-five teachings say that because the truth of suffering is the basis of the four errors, it's necessary to remove the error of knowing suffering universally and now knowing set universally.",
