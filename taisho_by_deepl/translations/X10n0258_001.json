If you contemplate it with a transmigration mind, it will spin back and forth. But when it reaches the limit of transmigration, you can't enter the ocean of buddhas. It's like destroying gold ore. Gold exists because it's not destroyed. Even though it's originally gold, it's finally accomplished by destroying it. Once it becomes a true gold body, it's no longer ore. Birth-and-death and nirvāṇa, worldlings and buddhas are all the same in terms of their emptiness and flowers. When contemplated, they're still illusory and transformative, much less deluded.
