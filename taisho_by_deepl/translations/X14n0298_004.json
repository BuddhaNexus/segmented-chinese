How could they suddenly arise, mountains, rivers, and other things that arise and cease, and then begin again? Since they're called pure and innate, where else could there be mountains, rivers, and other things that arise and cease, which are caused by the wisdom eye of others that isn't empty, a cataract in the eye, and empty flowers that arise in disorder?
