(The two concentrations that have maturation are those in which the concentration of no-thought brings about the results of the five aggregates of the non-thought heaven and those in which the concentration of cessation brings about the results of the four aggregates of maturation in the peerless heaven.) Since the two concentrations can't lead to the result, what is the full result? A. The commentary in the Vibhāṣā council says that it should be explained that the concentration of no-thought is the only result of the concentration of no-thought, that the many parts of the life root and the maturation of the five color faculties are the results of the fourth concentration, that the other parts of the aggregates are the results of mental activity, and that the other parts are the common result.",
