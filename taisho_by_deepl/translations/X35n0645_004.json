        "translation": "[Commentary] The arousal of names is the unambiguous development of the three kinds of bodhi, the aspiration and practice of mind, the confrontation of confrontation and objects, the feverish perfection of subduing the three disturbances, the accomplishment of contemplation, and the name if names, even though they diligently cultivate the eight factors to become a vehicle because they haven't yet been enlightened, are not called arousals. The arousal of contemplation and practice is called names because these five classes are not true and not seeming, but faith, understanding, interpretation, and subtle names.",
