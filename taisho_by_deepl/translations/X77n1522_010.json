The bodhisattva arouses the intention to universally aid living things, become close to the beggar, speaks gently and looks softly, you're poor and you're destitute, you take and seek, food, clothing, toys, treasures, cities, wives, heads, eyes, marrow, brains, internal and external gifts, nothing is given, there's no body, and the donor and recipient are also no one. Only then can they be freed from the marks of abiding, merge with the Tathāgata of Emptiness, and become the tenth volume of the Sixth Hokke Biographies of Learned Monks from the New Collection of Merit (published by Siming Hu Tai Zhi).",
