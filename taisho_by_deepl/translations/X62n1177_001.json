        "translation": "There are not as many practices as mindfulness of the Buddha. A person who is mindful of the Buddha has few afflictions, uses effort in both leisure and work, and one day is exempt from the examination of Yama. He is mindful when walking, mindful when staying, and mindful when applying skillful means in walking and staying. Why should he ask about the face of his mother? He is mindful when sitting, mindful when lying down, mindful when scattered and dazed, and he illuminates a great chiliocosm. The land of paradise is not far away. One thought can suddenly transcend the present. The land of paradise is not far away. The falling flowers and flowing water illustrate the true truth. Sentient beings are falsely thought to be separated from the clouds. Seven layers of trees and jewels are misplaced, and beryl is the ground, and the golden pavilion is made of gold. The fragrant breeze blows on the body and is pleasant and warm.",
