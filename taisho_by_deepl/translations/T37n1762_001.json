        "translation": "My teacher Yama deeply understood that the nature of mind has no external essence, so he consistently applied both the doctrine and the doctrine to both nature and characteristics. He wrote such books as the combined commentary on the Brahmā's Net, the profound text on the Buddha's apex, the essentials of mind-only consciousness, and the essentials of the interpretation of Mahāyāna calming and insight to elucidate the marvelous principle of expediency and reality.",
