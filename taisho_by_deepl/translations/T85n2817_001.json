This is true reliance on the Three Treasures. The buddhas appear in the world like the udumbara, like a blind turtle that regrets meeting a floating log. It's rare that a human body is difficult to obtain, and it's difficult to find a date when it's lost. In this body, he always abandons the eight difficulties, always cultivates and makes effort according to the teachings, and his good and bad actions don't perish. As causes bring about seeds, so does the result. Therefore, he avoids the ten bad qualities, diligently cultivates the ten good qualities, skillfully discerns their two truths, always abandons transmigration and seeks liberation, diligently practices the right path, and increases his wisdom. May he cultivate the noble paths and realize nothingness.",
