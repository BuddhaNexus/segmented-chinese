The pure and defiled city of transformation, which has been a mutual family since time immemorial, is filled with compassion for the dim and distant streets, yet this jeweled candle is not one light, not many lights, and the vowed light interlaces all the affairs of the Buddha. In the suffering world, marvelous sounds are produced, the voice speaks, and I am exhorted to travel west. There is no east or west, but the whole is entrusted to the one Buddha, which is this sahāva, and the name is held by the unknowable.",
