From the chaos of worldly affairs, he enjoys the naturalness of his place where fame and profit are ended. The mind of a good practitioner is good, looks ahead and back, and expects continuity of purpose. The person who practices rightly seems to be level, with an inch of mind that's not obscured by the knowledge of myriad dharmas, breaks through the authorities with few trifles, penetrates the true and counteracts the true of nothing, and the principle of the right practitioner is aligned. The path is the body of the infinite vacuum, and the principle is derived from the great function of the path. The right practitioner is very open-minded, and suddenly has a reflection when he sees the Tathāgata.",
