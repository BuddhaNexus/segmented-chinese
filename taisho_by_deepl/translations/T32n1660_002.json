        "translation": "\"That perfection of giving and so forth, which is achieved by the power of effort, makes effort the root. Bodhisattvas and others attain the Buddha's body, and they pursue buddhahood with effort and skill. I'm mindful that effort is superior to effort because it's abandoned, and it's not possible for effort to do what it does. If there were only one effort, then there would be no effort to do what is done, and all that is done is done with effort. Therefore, effort is superior to effort, and the mind has the skillful power to do it. This mind arises from effort. Therefore, all the things that are done have effort as their root, and all the treatises and arts and crafts reach the other shore because of effort. Therefore, among all the works that are done, effort is the most accomplished, and all the possessions and property that a person of effort attains can be obtained. Therefore, all the things that are pleasant and enjoyable have effort as their cause because of superior effort.",
