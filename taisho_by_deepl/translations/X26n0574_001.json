This is a straightforward statement that sentient beings are fully endowed with the vacuum and marvelous nature of the Dharma body throughout time, never arising or ceasing, unchanging or undistorted, neither coming nor going, neither old nor new, and so forth. The great superintendent says, \"Silence is few and isolated, independent and unchanging, traveling around and not in danger.\" He also says, \"Silence is motionless, and the four and five aggregates can be produced and disappeared by others, and in their own Dharma body there's always no involvement.\" Since there's no involvement, how can each step not be separate from the other? The old virtuous saying goes, \"Harmonizing light and dust are undefiled, and the three realms are honored alone.\" Chuan Lao also says, \"Where you can swim, you can swim.\" Clouds fly high and water flows by themselves.",
