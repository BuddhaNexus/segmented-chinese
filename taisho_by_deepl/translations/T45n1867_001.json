The Tathāgata's Dharma body is inconceivable, formless, signless, and without parallel. He shows form and form for sentient beings, and none of them are manifested in the subtle dust of all the Buddha bases. Luciana's manifestation of his unimpeded power, his vast vow to the Buddha ocean, and his vibrating voice tame all sentient beings and make them cultivate, refine, and enter the correct method of calming and insight.",
