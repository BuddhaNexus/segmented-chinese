You should observe the Buddha's supernormal powers, the clouds of flame that emanate from his or her pores, shining in the world, and his light has no limit. You should observe the Buddha's body, which has an extremely pure network of light, has form and so forth, pervades all the ten directions, and has a marvelous sound that pervades the world.",
