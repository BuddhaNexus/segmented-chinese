According to the sutra, after the bodhisattva Mahāsattva abides in śūraṃgama-samādhi and cultivates the one hundred samādhis, then he enters vajrasamādhi. The one hundred samādhis arise from the knowledge of the path's seeds and ten mysteries, and then he abides in the burning ground without perfuming or cultivating, and then he naturally and permanently attains 84,000 samādhis, which are the result of the absence of coming and going, abiding and cessation, and his mind is tranquil.",
