This is the meaning of samāpatti, that is, the so-called intrinsic nature, that is, the abiding true mind as explained above, that is, the immovable true nature, that is, the true reality, that is, the true characteristics, and the perfect awakening that is, space as it is, is equal and immovable, which is known as the equality of the awakening nature and immovability.",
