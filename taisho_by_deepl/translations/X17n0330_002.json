Is it different from the non-Buddhist who says nonexistence in contrast to the non-observers who observe that deluded conceptions don't arise? The reason for this is that the Buddha says that it's not the observation that deluded conceptions don't arise, but the awakening of all deluded conceptions of existence and nonexistence that don't have an inherent nature in the present is that they don't arise in the first place.",

This is called the pratyekabuddha vehicle, which is the cessation of ignorance and the ability to give rise to supernormal powers, mindfulness, body, and various manifestations, free from combinations, and unhindered.

Once the seed nature has been formed, those who can accord with sentient beings and share that seed nature in explaining the Dharma of twelve causes and conditions cause people to observe conditions and awaken to the path.",
