The verse says that emptiness is impermanent and buddha means that the characteristic of space is always comprehended, so how can it be said that buddhas arise and cease? The first one says this because it's the view that the essence of all things is originally quiescent like space, but foolish people deludedly conceptualize or make constant conceptions or make buddha conceptions like rivers, etc. How do they know that the nature of space is originally nonexistent? buddhas calm afflictions and so forth, and the right verse brings out the hidden meaning that when buddhas can be comprehended, afflictions can be calmed, the essence is quiescent, and naturally free from activity.",
