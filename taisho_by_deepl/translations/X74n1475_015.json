        "translation": "Even if this body reaches a hundred years of age, it will eventually meet with death, and even if it dies without a set limit, how can it stand still and not be frightened? Like a bird tethered by a rope that always ties its leg, like a fish feeding on a hook that swallows its hook, how can a demon suddenly come and chase it away, how can friends and relatives lament and stay when they see such peril and suffering, how can they be free of desire and finally cultivate meditation? Meditation is the only way to achieve happiness. As the sutra says in its verse, \"If there's such a deluded mind, then after craving, desire, and happiness, and after attaining disillusionment, their mind immediately gives rise to regret.",
