These two are in fact nonexistent. It is only the transmutation of consciousness that creates the two appearances. # &lt;br/&gt;Next, it is clear that there are three kinds of the object: # &lt;br/&gt;the retributive consciousness is the storeconsciousness, the grasping consciousness is the appropriating consciousness, and the dust consciousness is the sixth consciousness. # &lt;br/&gt;The retributive consciousness is projected by the actions of the defilements ; therefore it is called the retributive consciousness.</td>
